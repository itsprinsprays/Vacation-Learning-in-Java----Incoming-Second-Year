Where to use :
Consumer Object can be used to organized the code to make it cleaner and it is reusable

	List<Student> stud = new ArrayList<>(Arrasys.asList(
					new Student("Prince",20,"BSIT"),
					new Student("Andrei",18,"BSCpE"),
					new Student("Lannce",18,"BSCS")
					));

Side Learning :

instanceof - this can be used in all wrapper class 
		instanceof Student student)
Number - it is a superclass that hold all the numerical wrapper class and it can be narrowedly cast 
		List<Number> number = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(10, 0, -5, 25));
