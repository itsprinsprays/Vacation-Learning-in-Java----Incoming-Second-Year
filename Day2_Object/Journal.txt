Day 2 : Object

An object is an instance of a class. It can store data (fields/attributes) and use methods defined inside its class.
For example, I have a Person class that has fields for name, age, and sex, and a printInfo() method to display them.
I create (instantiate) a Person object in main using the new keyword and pass parameters to its constructor.

How I called it :

  Person p = new Person(name, age, sex); // the parameter is the variable of scanner;
  p.printInfo()

Where to used it:

I can use objects to organize my code and make it more readable. Since methods inside an object are reusable, I can call them whenever I need that functionality.
