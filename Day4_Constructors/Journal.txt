Day 4: Constructors 

- It can have parameters (optional).
- It is called automatically when the object is created using the new keyword in main.
- The constructorâ€™s name must match the class name (in Java, the file name usually matches the public class name).
- It can have field variables (global) and parameter variables (local).
- If the parameter names are the same as the field names, the this keyword is used to refer to the field. - If the names are different, this is not required.

Example : 

	StudentInfo SI = new StudentInfo(firstname,lastname,year,course,section,midtermGrade,finalGrade);
		
		SI.introduceSelf();
		SI.evaluateGrade();

Where to Used : 

I used the constructors here to get the information of the student then the SI.introduceSelf(); prints the personal information of the studemts. The SI.evaluateGrade(); will evaluate what grades they got.
