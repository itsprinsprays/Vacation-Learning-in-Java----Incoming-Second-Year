Day 5 : Encapsulation

Encapsulation makes the variable in private, it can just used inside that class and it cant be called in other file. It needs to have a getter and setter. Once the value was done it cant be change anymore unlesss used the setter to change it.

The Setter or "set" keyword along with the name makes the variable accessible to other file and the value can be change.
 Getter "get" keywords means it can be accessible and be printed 

Example : 

private String name,types;
	
	
	Animal(String name, String types) {
		this.name = name;
		this.types = types;
	}
	
	
	
	void setName(String name) {
		this.name = name;
	}
	
	String getName() {
		return name;
	}
	
	String getTypes() {
		return types;
	}
Bird b = new Bird("Parrot","Bird")
String name = b.getName(); //get the name
String type = b.getType(); //set the name

b.setName("Eagle"); //change via setter

Where to used :

Encapsulation is useful when I want to protect data and control how it is accessed or modified â€” for example, in a banking app to control how balances are changed.
